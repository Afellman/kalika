        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you type “food waste” into Google’s search engine, it will not even take two upward strokes of your fingers before you find where Indonesia ranks in the world as a contributor. That’s </span><a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesia-second-largest-food-waster/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">300 kilograms</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> of food waste per person and you can bet that more than half of that is organic. This is deeply saddening (and not to mention ironic) in a country where 8% of its whopping 4th largest global population still suffers from chronic </span><a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">hunger</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you are wondering which countries produce the most plastic waste that ends up down the orifices of sea turtles, yes, Indonesia will be found on top three of top three of that list too. Smack in the middle of ‘The Coral Triangle’ boasting the world’s highest diversity of coral reef fish, it is hard to digest that every single day, citizens of the nation are unknowingly contributing to the immense suffering of countless marine life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The fact that they import massive amounts of trash in containers from neighbouring countries doesn’t help. Suffice it to say, this creates a two-fold problem of food waste and a grossly incompetent plastic management system that insults food production efforts and the environment that allows us to do so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">So much waste, so little action?</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you think that Indonesians just don’t care as long the wedding parties are overflowing with food and bananas are individually wrapped in cling film, </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">then you are wrong!</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span><a href=\"https://nowjakarta.co.id/magazine-issue/the-culinary-issue/food-banks-the-solution-for-food-waste\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Multiple NGOs</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> have made great strides in attempting to achieve zero hunger with leftover food before it becomes waste.

Founders Nina Widjaja and Reky Martha, who had recently returned to their homeland in 2016, were dumbfounded by the reckless manner in which waste collects, be it on land or underwater. Their individual lifestyle changes in response to the</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(74, 134, 232);\"> </span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">environmental calamity</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(74, 134, 232);\"> </span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">inadvertently turned into an enterprise that could help fellow Indonesians make those changes too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">What exactly is a KALIKA?&nbsp;</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Starting out as a home DIY project to ease their pain in seeing so much plastic waste around them, reusable beeswax food wraps became their first solution to empower everyday folk to do the same. Sustainability and environmental consciousness are more than just personal philosophies, but also the building blocks of the business. KALIKA works with local communities in responsibly harvesting wild forest beeswax. As it turns out, ancient human civilizations have been using beeswax to preserve their food rotting and it is high time we bring this tradition back!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Think about the chain of benefits that come when you start wrapping your food with a KALIKA. You keep the food fresh longer, essentially giving it a second life. You keep money in your pocket because you are actually getting the </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">most</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> out of the food you buy. You keep quality food out of countless heaps of landfills. You keep unnecessary plastic waste out of the oceans because these wraps are 100% reusable. We could go on and on.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">So, to wrap up...</span></h3><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">KALIKA is here to offer you not just resources, but also lessons in learning how to keep your food as fresh as long as possible, which helps reduce food waste and single-use plastics as a briiliantly beneficial by-product. That being said, are you ready to give your food a second life?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

Experiment to find the right recipe on what works best for you. Start by establishing your own food waste and plastic management systems. Take a look inside your fridge. Do you see any dried out fruit, moldy cheese and rock-solid bread? Now just walk around your home. Do you see any plastic haphazardly lying around?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">Give your food a second life by learning how to </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">actually</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\"> keep it fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Food waste is third on the list created by </span><a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Project Drawdown</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, a fantastically put together organization that tackles the climate conundrum with gusto.

Second, ask yourself whether you are contributing to food waste, why this is happening, and what you can do to remedy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Have you ever wondered why even when you wrap your food in cling film, it ends up soggy (or more or less dead-looking) before you come back to turn it into a smoothie? It’s because plastic </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">suffocates</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> your food. Even human skin has itty bitty pores that allow sweat to seep through so we can cool down when it gets too hot. Food has a similar mechanism.

We are just extremely incompetent in figuring out what to do with it once we don’t need it anymore. What we throw in a bin, ends up in a landfill, then into the ocean which gets eaten by the fish and ultimately eaten by us. So in a nutshell, our mismanagement of plastic is invariably leading to us eating… trash!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">How KALIKA will help you live minimal waste.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Food banks are a great way to avoid food waste.

It means your food does not need to be subjected to an early second death because you are busy with everyday life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Critics will argue that beeswax food wraps are too expensive and that sustainable living should not cater </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">only</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> to the wealthy.

        "title": "7 Reasons Why KALIKA makes the Best Reusable Beeswax Food Wraps ",
        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By now, you must already bee familiar with the program, right? We, at KALIKA, help empower everyday folk to reduce personal food waste and plastic consumption by using our reusable beeswax food wraps. With the plethora of options now made available to order and arrive at your doorstep, why should you choose KALIKA over ALL the others? Let us help you decide.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">We know that using the word “best” can be provocative but look, “best” is something </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">better than the rest</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Deciding what is best obviously needs to be analysed across all possible parameters, which is just what we have done in this article!&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">1. We use wild forest beeswax to make our food wraps.&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Do you </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">know</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> what beeswax is? Do you know how honey is </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">made</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">? The entire process is so long and complicated, yet structured and organized, that instead of running </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">helter-skelter</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> when a bee buzzes your way, you will applaud that highly competent winged productivity capsule.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Essentially, beeswax is a by-product of bees’ honey-making process. Commercial acquisition of beeswax from bee farmers typically poses risks for bee welfare as humans tend to harvest </span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">all</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> the honey. This increases the need to feed bees sugar water which, in excess, could lower overall bee productivity as they start storing sugar water in the hive in place of honey!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">We get our beeswax from rainforests on the Indonesian islands of Flores and Sumatra. We work together with forest bee farmers who harvest honey with ethical and sustainable practices. As it is their livelihood, they understand that destroying bee hives by overharvesting is counterproductive and wasteful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The good thing is that the bees get to live freely and since only the mature part of their nest is harvested, they do not have to start entirely from scratch. The downside is that this is a bit of a hazard for the forest bee farmers who have to climb massive trees, but safety is always an utmost priority and there have been no casualties thus far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">∴</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> KALIKA gets beeswax from happy bees.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">2. We are fair-trade.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">When you harvest honey, you harvest the beeswax too. Unfortunately, most forest bee farmers do not know the true value of beeswax and simply dispose of it because it adds cost when you have to transport all that excess weight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">KALIKA works with organizations that help educate forest bee farmers on the importance of using nature’s by-products to its full potential. This way, we know we get our beeswax in a responsible manner, and the forest bee farmers get to make additional profits from selling some gunk they would otherwise just throw away. Don’t we all just love these win-win scenarios?&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">3. We get our fabric from working with local artisans.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For special edition beeswax food wraps, KALIKA works with local artisans to make </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">batik</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> prints that are hand stamped using 100% natural dyes. Some of these prints honestly look like they belong in a museum! So go ahead and wrap your lemon in a work of art.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Browse our </span><a href=\"https://www.tokopedia.com/search?st=product&amp;q=kalika%20beeswax%20food%20wrap\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">shop</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> and compare it to the typical “beehive”/ “logo” motives of other beeswax food wrap merchants, and it will be near impossible to resist. Don’t lie, you know you want to wrap a handful of cashew nuts in that pink polka-dotted one. Our prints are candy for your eyes!&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">4. We produce in-house with a diverse team.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">KALIKA empowers an incredibly diverse team of people (young, old, men, women, you name it!) from various walks of life to commune daily in a small workshop to produce high-quality beeswax food wraps. Tender (and gloved) hands have crafted with the finest attention to detail, to perfect every single KALIKA. No big machinery, just manual labour and love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">5. We ensure our products are affordable.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This time, browse the other sellers of beeswax food wraps and look at how much wanting to live more sustainably will cost you. KALIKA ensures that </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">everyone</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> can be a part of the solution by ensuring that our products are kept affordable. Costing you at least 40% less than the market average, it’s an investment, bargain and a great deal every single time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The stubborn adversaries should also stop fixating on how much money one spends on the wrap, instead on how much money one saves from throwing food in the bin. These beeswax food wraps are also re-u-sa-ble! We guarantee that if you actually did the math of calculating the cost of not using the wrap versus using it, you will regret not owning a KALIKA much sooner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">6. We have a recipe that works wonders.</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Our recipe which combines wild forest beeswax, tree resin and coconut oil, was a laborious undertaking of over 6 months worth of trial and error before we found one that… sticks!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Naturally, multiple home experiments, countless gooey accidents and competitor analysis are all part and parcel of the process. Yet, we eventually found a recipe that keeps the beeswax food wrap tight and taut around whatever it is you are trying to keep fresh longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">7. We try to be waste-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The best part about small companies, is that you can control virtually every single thing that goes on in it. Our aim, for both business </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">and</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> production, has always been to create a simple 2-in-1 solution on how to reduce food waste and plastic pollution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">With in-house production powered by a team of skilled and dedicated worker bees, we make sure that almost nothing goes to waste. Even the fabrics are pre-measured before ordering and are trimmed with such precision, that loose threads littering the floor like cat hair is all the waste we ever see.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Where most companies struggle to practice zero-waste as their commercial ambitions often far override sustainable practices, we are proud to say that we make every possible effort to be wastefree.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);\">So, to wrap up…&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Are you convinced yet? Or is there a parameter we are missing out? Let us know in the comments what you think, or rather, which KALIKA you decided to buy!&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>"
