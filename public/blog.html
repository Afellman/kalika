          <!-- Play with spacing -->
          <p>If you type “food waste” into Google’s search engine, it will not even take two upward strokes of your
            fingers before you find where Indonesia ranks in the world as a contributor. That’s <a
              href="https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesia-second-largest-food-waster/" target="_blank">300
              kilograms</a> of food
            waste per person and you can bet that more than half of that is organic. This is deeply saddening (and not
            to mention ironic) in a country where 8% of its whopping 4th largest global population still suffers from
            chronic <a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia" target="_blank">hunger.</a> </p>

          <p>If you are wondering which countries produce the most plastic waste that ends up down the orifices of sea
            turtles, yes, Indonesia will be found on top three of top three of that list too. Smack in the middle of
            ‘The Coral Triangle’ boasting the world’s highest diversity of coral reef fish, it is hard to digest that
            every single day, citizens of the nation are unknowingly contributing to the immense suffering of countless
            marine life. </p>

          <p>The fact that they import massive amounts of trash in containers from neighbouring countries doesn’t help.
            Suffice it to say, this creates a two-fold problem of food waste and a grossly incompetent plastic
            management system that insults food production efforts and the environment that allows us to do so. </p>

          <h5>So much waste, so little action?</h5>

          <p>If you think that Indonesians just don’t care as long the wedding parties are overflowing with food and
            bananas are individually wrapped in cling film, <strong>then you are wrong!</strong> <a
              href="https://nowjakarta.co.id/magazine-issue/the-culinary-issue/food-banks-the-solution-for-food-waste"
              target="_blank">Multiple NGOs have made</a>
            great strides in
            attempting to achieve zero hunger with leftover food before it becomes waste. Bali’s monumental move in
            being the first province to <a
              href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/in-indonesia-a-court-victory-for-balis-ban-on-single-use-plastics/"
              target="_blank">ban</a> the use of single use plastic proves that the
            public are fed up with the
            damage that has been, and is being done.</p>

          <h5>Meet KALIKA’s founders.</h5>

          <p>It is within the parameters outlining the food waste and plastic crisis that KALIKA came to life. Founders
            Nina Widjaja and Reky Martha, who had recently returned to their homeland in 2016, were dumbfounded by the
            reckless manner in which waste collects, be it on land or underwater. Their individual lifestyle changes in
            response to the environmental <u>calamity</u> inadvertently turned into an enterprise that could help
            fellow
            Indonesians make those changes too. </p>

          <h5>What exactly is a KALIKA? </h5>

          <p>Starting out as a home DIY project to ease their pain in seeing so much plastic waste around them, reusable
            beeswax food wraps became their first solution to empower everyday folk to do the same. Sustainability and
            environmental consciousness are more than just personal philosophies, but also the building blocks of the
            business. KALIKA works with local communities in responsibly harvesting wild forest beeswax. As it turns
            out, ancient human civilizations have been using beeswax to preserve their food rotting and it is high time
            we bring this tradition back! </p>

          <p>Think about the chain of benefits that come when you start wrapping your food with a KALIKA. You keep the
            food fresh longer, essentially giving it a second life. You keep money in your pocket because you are
            actually getting the most out of the food you buy. You keep quality food out of countless heaps of
            landfills. You keep unnecessary plastic waste out of the oceans because these wraps are 100% reusable. We
            could go on and on.</p>
          <h5>So, to wrap up...</h5>

          <p> <strong>KALIKA</strong> is here to offer you not just resources, but also <u>lessons</u> in learning how
            to keep
            your food as fresh as long as possible, which helps reduce food waste and single-use plastics as a
            briiliantly beneficial by-product. That being said, are you ready to give your food a second life? </p>

        <h3 class=" section-title"> How Reusable Beeswax Food Wraps can Reduce Food Waste and Plastic Pollution</h3>
        <!-- Play with spacing -->
        <p>Doesn’t it sometimes seem like we have forgotten that we are humans <em>living on planet Earth?</em> That’s
          about as
          fundamental as it gets when it comes to explaining our existence. Yet, many of our actions have caused so much
          harm to our planet, that aliens observing us from far away must be baffled and asking themselves; “Why are
          these people destroying their home?”.</p>
        <h5>The environment is in peril. </h5>
        <p>In more recent times however, the movement raging towards trying to mitigate the climate crisis has certainly
          prompted change. More and more individuals are starting to ask themselves “what can I do?”. Not all of us can
          skip school and strike outside the parliament, right? There are so many problems to tackle, but where to
          begin?</p>

        <p>The fact that they import massive amounts of trash in containers from neighbouring countries doesn’t help.
          Suffice it to say, this creates a two-fold problem of food waste and a grossly incompetent plastic
          management system that insults food production efforts and the environment that allows us to do so. </p>

        <p>Keep things simple and just start from home. Experiment to find the right recipe on what works best for you.
          Start by establishing your own food waste and plastic management systems. Take a look inside your fridge. Do
          you see any dried out fruit, moldy cheese and rock-solid bread? Now just walk around your home. Do you see any
          plastic haphazardly lying around? .</p>

        <h5>Give your food a second life by learning how to <em>actually</em> keep it fresh. </h5>

        <p>Food waste is third on the list created by Project Drawdown, a fantastically put together organization that
          tackles the climate conundrum with gusto. First, understand that food loss and food waste are two different
          things. Second, ask yourself whether you are contributing to food waste, why this is happening, and what you
          can do to remedy it. </p>

        <p>Have you ever wondered why even when you wrap your food in cling film, it ends up soggy (or more or less
          dead-looking) before you come back to turn it into a smoothie? It’s because plastic suffocates your food. Even
          human skin has itty bitty pores that allow sweat to seep through so we can cool down when it gets too hot.
          Food has a similar mechanism. It needs to breathe too! </p>

        <h5>We definitely <strong>do not</strong> know how to manage all this plastic waste. </h5>

        <p>Look, there is nothing essentially wrong with plastic in itself. We are just extremely incompetent in
          figuring out what to do with it once we don’t need it anymore. What we throw in a bin, ends up in a landfill,
          then into the ocean which gets eaten by the fish and ultimately eaten by us. So in a nutshell, our
          mismanagement of plastic is invariably leading to us eating… trash! </p>
        <h5>How KALIKA will help you live minimal waste.</h5>
        <p>Food banks are a great way to avoid food waste. But what about simpler individual actions one can take? We
          have cleared that wrapping your food in plastic does not really work and we know that beeswax contains
          antibacterial properties that prevent your food from becoming a home for microorganisms in a way cling film
          and plastic containers could only ever dream of.</p>
        <p>Reusable food packaging means you can say “NO!” to anyone who offers you a plastic bag to put your spinach
          in. It means you can go about your day knowing your artisan bread will stay nice and moist for an extra day or
          two. It means your food does not need to be subjected to an early second death because you are busy with
          everyday life. </p>
        <p>Critics will argue that beeswax food wraps are too expensive and that sustainable living should not cater
          only to the wealthy. To them we say, look up the word investment. KALIKA sells the most affordable beeswax
          food wraps in the world. After it has served you for over a year, you can toss it in your compost pile without
          the guilt of choking turtles swimming in your nightmares.</p>

        <h5>So, to wrap up...</h5>

        <p> <strong>KALIKA</strong> offers a simple and cost-effective solution in dealing with the immense food waste
          and plastic pollution that us, humans, are producing. Despite that our lifespans being barely a blink in the
          bigger picture of life, our actions today are what determine the fate of our home planet tomorrow. While
          activists and NGOs power on the pass policies preserving the planet, what can you do today, right from home,
          that will help planet Earth tomorrow? </p>
